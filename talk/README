These are all the files needed for the astropy talk.   The talk can be 
updated/created by running:

To update the notebook:
ipython notebook astropy_talk.ipynb 

To update the slides:
ipython nbconvert astropy_talk.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template slides.tpl

The templates are required for the link to the mathjax library to
work properly.
